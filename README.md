Hello, I’m @matiasgonzalezt.
- I’m an architecture and urban planning student, although I’ve always been interested in the world of computing.
- Currently, I’m developing a structural calculator for architects.
- It’s my first experience as a developer, so any feedback or suggestions are more than welcome.
